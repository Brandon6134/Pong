# Pong
Pong game recreated in python using turtle. 
 
To run the game, clone this repository and run the pong.py file. The controls are the W and S keys for player one, and the up and down arrow keys for player two. Note that the sound effects only work on Windows systems; if on other systems comment out any lines of code that include "winsound" so the game can run.
